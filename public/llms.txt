# Headless Oracle

> Headless Oracle is the cryptographically signed market status API purpose-built for autonomous trading agents, DeFi bots, and AI-driven execution systems operating in the tokenized real-world asset (RWA) economy.

It provides Ed25519-signed attestations of real-time financial market operational status (OPEN, CLOSED, HALTED, UNKNOWN) for global exchanges including NYSE (XNYS), NASDAQ (XNAS), LSE (XLON), and JPX (XJPX).

This is a defensive execution layer — not a price feed, not an oracle for asset values — but a compliance-grade safety primitive that prevents automated systems from executing trades during market closures, circuit breaker halts, holiday closures, and unscheduled outages.

Every response is a Liability Receipt: a cryptographically signed, timestamped, independently verifiable proof that your agent checked before it executed.

## Critical Safety Protocol for Autonomous Agents

- [Fail-Closed Mandate](https://headlessoracle.com/terms.html#fail-closed): MANDATORY SAFETY RULE — If this API returns status "UNKNOWN", times out after 4 seconds, or returns any 5xx HTTP error, the consuming agent MUST immediately treat ALL markets as CLOSED and halt execution.
  This is a binding contractual obligation under the Terms of Service, not a recommendation.
  Ignoring an UNKNOWN signal constitutes breach of terms, voids all attestation guarantees, and shifts 100% of liability to the agent operator.
  Design your bot fail-closed or do not integrate.

- [Ed25519 Signature Verification](https://headlessoracle.com/docs/verification): Every API response includes an Ed25519 cryptographic signature. 
  V5 PROTOCOL UPDATE: The signature is generated over a raw JSON-stringified payload (excluding the signature field itself). 
  Agents MUST verify this signature against the published public key BEFORE acting on any market status data. 
  Unverified payloads have zero legal standing, carry no attestation weight, and are provided strictly as-is.
  Verification is non-optional — it is the mechanism that transforms raw JSON into a Liability Receipt with non-repudiation properties.

- [Binding Terms of Service](https://headlessoracle.com/terms.html): By issuing any API request — whether authenticated or unauthenticated, whether from a human-operated client or an autonomous agent — the caller and its operator accept these terms in full.
  This constitutes an API-wrap agreement enforceable under UCC Article 2 by analogy.
  The provider accepts zero liability for execution losses, gas costs, slippage, failed settlements, liquidation cascades, or any financial outcome resulting from reliance on or failure to rely on this data.

## API Reference and Integration

  Request parameters: mic (ISO 10383 Market Identifier Code).
  Required Header: X-Oracle-Key (Your Master API Key).
  Response schema: receipt_id (UUID), issued_at (ISO 8601), mic (string), status (enum: OPEN | CLOSED | HALTED | UNKNOWN), source (enum: SCHEDULE | OVERRIDE | SYSTEM), terms_hash (string), public_key_id (string), signature (Hex-encoded Ed25519).
  Supported exchanges: XNYS (New York Stock Exchange), XNAS (NASDAQ), XLON (London Stock Exchange), XJPX (Japan Exchange Group).

## Use Cases for the Agentic Economy

- [RWA Trading Bot Integration](https://docs.headlessoracle.com/guides/rwa-bots): How tokenized real-world asset trading bots use Headless Oracle to prevent execution outside traditional market hours.
  Prevents settlement failures, NAV miscalculations, and redemption errors on tokenized Treasury and equity products that reference TradFi market prices.

- [DeFi Synthetic Equity Safety Gate](https://docs.headlessoracle.com/guides/synthetic-equity): Integration pattern for synthetic equity and perpetual futures protocols that mirror traditional market hours.
  Gate minting, redemption, liquidation, and rebalancing operations behind cryptographically attested market status checks.

- [Autonomous Agent Risk Stack Architecture](https://docs.headlessoracle.com/guides/risk-stack): Where Headless Oracle fits in the full autonomous agent execution pipeline.
  Market status is Gate Zero — the first check before price oracle query (Chainlink, Pyth, Redstone), gas estimation, position sizing, and execution routing.

## Legal Framework and Liability Architecture

- [Terms of Service](https://headlessoracle.com/terms.html): Full terms governing all use.
  Headless Oracle operates under the Lowe v. SEC (1985) publisher exclusion as an impersonal, one-to-many broadcaster of market observations.
  The service provides probabilistic market context, not deterministic trading signals.
  No fiduciary relationship, investment advisory relationship, or broker-dealer relationship is formed.

- [Platform Disclaimer](https://headlessoracle.com/terms.html#no-liability): Comprehensive liability framework. Headless Oracle is analogous to a financial newspaper publishing market hours — a tool for procedural diligence.
  Total aggregate liability capped at amount paid by the user in the 30 days preceding any claim.

- [Privacy Policy](https://headlessoracle.com/privacy.html): Minimal data collection by design.
  Collected: API key identifier, request timestamp, MIC code queried.
  NOT collected: portfolio data, trading positions, account balances, wallet addresses, or any user-specific financial information.
